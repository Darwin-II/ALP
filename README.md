# ALP
The Advanced Logic Processor Binaries

Huh, documentation time. ALP has 6 standard functions which are:

stanfun1.out - addition

stanfun2.out - subtraction

stanfun3.out - multiplication

stanfun4,out - division

stanfun5.out - swapping

stanfun6.out - random number

These standard functions are used in blocks of five to create a neural net, made of 256 functions. These functions are generated by evo.out. Good look, perhaps you'll get this further than I did.

Have a gander at design.txt, it contains an outdated but still mostly correct design and plan for ALP.

I KEEP TELLING YOU GUYS IT'S NOT A VIRUS
